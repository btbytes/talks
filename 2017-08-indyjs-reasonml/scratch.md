# Types vs Tests

- "Haskell all the things" is not the answer
- types == abstractions. more specifics. Reduce the domain
- "Lectures on Curry-Howard Isomorphism" -- code to formal logic
> Type signature is theorem, function definition is the Proof

Types:

- reduce bugs -- goal --
- make code run faster -- type annotations can be used by compilers (could happen)
- define interfaces
- check compilance
- **document model**
- different levels of type-systems
- refinement types, independent types

Tests:
+ reduce bugs
- cannot make code run faster, define interfaces,
+ Test "logic"
?? REPL Tests .. what happens to test suites.
